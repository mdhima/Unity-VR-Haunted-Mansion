Project Title: Haunted Mansion Escape

Project Authors: Magdalena Dhima and Besar Kapllani

Project Description:

An immersive virtual reality game. Our game will be set in a spooky, haunted house environment. Players will navigate through the house, solve puzzles, unlock doors, discover hidden chambers, interact with the environment and characters, and ultimately escape the haunted house. Our game focuses primarily on diegetic interactions, with users being able to interact with the characters, environment, and items in many ways. Items are the main system of the game, and the player can throw them, add them to their inventory, give them to characters, and even manipulate the environment with them. Key items allow the user to progress through the game, and are hidden throughout the environment. The user navigates with fade teleportation.
